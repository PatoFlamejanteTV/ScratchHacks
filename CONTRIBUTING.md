## Getting Started

To work effectively within our codebase, refer to [Introduction to Contributing](/contributing/working-in-contributor-repository.md). For guidance on writing markdown files, consult the [GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

Before making changes, review the [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept. Remember, not all contributions require coding!

### Issues

#### Creating a New Issue

To report a problem or suggest an improvement, first search for existing issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/windowszin/spinningchip/issues). If no relevant issue exists, you can create a new one using one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/windowszin/spinningchip/issues/new/choose).

#### Resolving Issues

Explore the [existing issues](https://github.com/windowszin/spinningchip/issues) and identify those that interest you. You can use labels to filter your search. Learn more about using labels in the [Labels Guide](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md). If you find an issue to work on, feel free to submit a pull request with your proposed solution.

### Making Changes

#### Making Changes via the UI

For minor edits like fixing typos, broken links, or sentences, you can directly edit the markdown files. Click on **Make a Contribution** at the bottom of any docs page, and it will take you to the corresponding `.md` file. After making your changes, create a [pull request](#pull-request) for review.
